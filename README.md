# Optimizing images in folder with Bash Scripts

These are two pretty simple bash scripts which are optimizing set of png and jpg/jpeg images located in a folder. Both of the scripts are just replacing the images with the optimized ones.

In order to execute them, download and compile following binaries

[jpegtran](http://www.ijg.org/)

[OptiPNG](http://optipng.sourceforge.net/)

In order to execute the scripts, simply use 

`optimize-jpgs.sh img` and/or `optimize-pngs.sh img`

where img is the name of the folder the images are located in.
